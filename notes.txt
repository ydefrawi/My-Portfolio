I'm an aspiring web developer and experienced Project Manager with a demonstrated history in marketing and digital project & process management. 
Skilled in Consulting, Business Process, E-Commerce, Digital Marketing & Analytics, and International Sourcing. 

I'm an enthusastic business professional with a serious passion for business, entepreneurship and technology. In a nutshell, I like creating and improving things. Coding to me is 
an art - a discipline of of creativity and problem solving combined. It gives us the ability to create incredible funcitonal applications that solve critical problems from an empty canvas. 
Utlimately developing is a way to create something functional from an empty canvas. I only wish I had sarted sooner?
