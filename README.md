# My Portfolio 

This page is an interactive portfolio demonstrating the skills we will accumulate over the coures of this program. It will contain a resume, a few web applications we develop with different tools, and should make great use of HTML/CSS and other front-end tools/plugins we want to implement to make it stand out aesthetically.  

## Screenshots

Few other images of responsiveness in the 'images' folder'! 

## Usage

Just a standard html page with an 'assets' folder, containing 'css' and 'images'. 


## Issues

I spent a lot of time on this assignment, primarily learning flex boxes in CSS. Since I chose to go with my own style and layout for this page it took me a while to implement. I'm more comforable with Flex now, but still have problems understanding exactly how 'inline-block' works.

Also when it comes to flex, I still dont quite understand how grow, shrink, and basis all work together to acheive  your desired result. I had trouble tring to tell the page where and how to break something onto another line with CSS. 

I also made the mistake of displaying the 'our applications' images with CSS box backgrounds - which of course meant I couldn't hyperlink the entire images, so i had to resort to just making the image titles hyperlinks. 

## Roadmap

I'd like to change the images to be layed out with HTML instead of CSS, and I'd like to work on some more responsiveness issues (The nav bars aren't as aesthetically pleasing as they could be at different resolutions)

Adding pseudo classes to change things on hover would also be a neat addition. I attempted to but I ended up creating more layout problems.. 

## Conclusion
Pretty difficult since we only just picked up Flex, but I learned a ton!
